\section{Problems of current Model Text Bridges}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Rule := Controller?
	\item Problem solutions of other frameworks are suggested.
\item how are updates handled (equality vs. IDs) \\
		- what's their scope (replace whole tree, substree) \\
		-	reuse of nodes (incremental parser reuse nodes to save time, not to keep identity)
\end{itemize}
