\paragraph{Alternative Textual Representations}
By conceptually extending the existing Parse Tree Constructor of Xtext, different textual representations are possible. The possible ambiguous mapping from model to Parse Tree is leveraged to allow different, context free grammar conform representations. For a user, a high degree of ``valid'' ambiguity is desirable, because it provides him with a higher variety of semantically equivalent representations. The extension of the Parse Tree Constructor requires it to calculate all instead of one possible valid solutions for a part of the word. Considering that the current Parse Tree Constructor uses Backtracking, a high degree of ambiguity is unfavorable for Parse Tree Constructor's runtime. Plain backtracking will not scale in calculating all solutions, especially regarding the combinatorial explosion of alternative combined list elements, so for practical use an improved algorithm is desirable. The alternative textual representations are alternative Parse Trees, thus the representations are not limited to different token values, but allow a different \emph{structural}. This can be leveraged at grammar design time to avoid manual model transformations. 

\paragraph{Structured Characters}
The use of the invented EMF Lexers Structured Characters to enable \code{EObject}s on the character stream \emph{as Terminals} releases the grammar from the burden to \emph{describe} all model elements, but still requires to \emph{declare} their occurrence. This hinders the user to textually change or create those \code{EObject} Terminals, so if the model should be ever be editable outside a specially adapter editor, their use should be avoided. Unhandled Structured Characters cause severe usability issues, because from the users perspective, they present themselves as $\square$, a squared ``black'' box.

\paragraph{Sentential Token based Editors}
after decl
Incremental visual DSL development from ``internal'' textual DSL
Micro Editors granularity 
Awesome CFG integration
UI framework lock, platform dependent MM. MM after text if platform dependant.
Editors depend on token, can reder themselves invalid


\paragraph{Effect of Unstable Models}
Stable models main problem
of struc char refs
 sentential tokens might contain data if chars are no additional representation, but this shifts from synchronization to referential integrity problem. My AWESOME notation model.

\paragraph{Current EMF based Solutions}
Conclusion: Parser generator not the problem and well understood.
Rant about fcking non incremental parsing.

\section{Drawbacks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item x permutations
	\item x dependency of editors to CFG (at least declare to)
	\item x txt structure structural dependent on model. Just partially a problem, last vis. state can be often recovered.
	\item x substitute language seq, but not arbitrary seq
	\item x dependencies (stable lang mod)
	\item o IDE lock, IDE dependencies
	\item o Parse Table++
	\item x Mem ++ , Notation Model
	\item x Runtime++ O(c$^N$) backtracking 4 all
	\item o more, fine grained editors
	\item x editor can be lost if it edits the model in a way that the specialized textual representation is not valid any more.
