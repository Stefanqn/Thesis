Incremental visual DSL development from ``internal'' textual DSL

Awesome CFG integration
Stable models main problem
other results,
emf lexer
different txt representations
utf8 char as id giving

\begin{itemize}
	\item Conclusion: Parser generator not the problem and well understood.
\end{itemize}	



\section{Achievements}
The concepts described in this th
\begin{itemize}
	\item x Multiple Txt rep
	\item x Sentential tokens
	\item x Editors on lang models
	\item x editors in place of symbols and seq. - editors integrate \& conform in CFG!
	\item x editors might be added after CFG created, no dep on CFG 2 editors
	\item x updating textual view if graphical editor changes something is not necessary in contrast to side by side editors.
	\item sentential tokens might contain data if chars are no additional representation, but this shifts from synchronization to referential integrity problem.
\end{itemize}

\section{Drawbacks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item x permutations
	\item x dependency of editors to CFG (at least declare to)
	\item x txt structure structural dependent on model. Just partially a problem, last vis. state can be often recovered.
	\item x substitute language seq, but not arbitrary seq
	\item x dependencies (stable lang mod)
	\item o IDE lock, IDE dependencies
	\item o Parse Table++
	\item x Mem ++ , Notation Model
	\item x Runtime++ O(c$^N$) backtracking 4 all
	\item o more, fine grained editors
	\item x editor can be lost if it edits the model in a way that the specialized textual representation is not valid any more.
\end{itemize}
