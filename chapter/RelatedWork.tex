Interestingly, with the exception of the Meta-Environment
and TEF, all tools that we described generate ANTLR
parsers. TEF uses a the RunCC parser generator. ANTLR s
LL(k) or LL(*) parsers cannot cope with left recursion in
grammars. Likewise, RunCCs LR(k) parsers are limited to
a subset of the context-free grammars. This means that they
are not closed under composition, which means that adding
extensions to a grammar or reusing grammars can introduce
conflicts in the parser [32].
