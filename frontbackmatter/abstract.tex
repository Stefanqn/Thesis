This thesis presents an approach to enable mixed textual and graphical editors on EMF models conforming an S-attributed EBNF grammar. It unifies the concepts of Sentential Tokens with Notation Models and suggests handling incomplete information in a character stream using synthetic characters. As atomic, well defined character UTF8 private use tokens are suggested.\end{abstract}
