This thesis presents an approach to enable mixed interchangeable textual and graphical editors on EMF models which still conform a context grammar. It unifies the concepts of Sentential Forms with structured, presentable tokens. Synthetic characters allow to resolve structured information from a single character. Alternative graphical editors can be created after the extended language was shipped. \end{abstract}
